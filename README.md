</div>

## why?

There are frequent tasks that I need to do on my server and different processes I need to keep track of.

keepalive does certain tasks for me, asks me for permission for more complex tasks and notifies me if something is wrong with server or my docker containers.

## requirements

-   python >= 3.10
